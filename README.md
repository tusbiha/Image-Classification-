Animal Image Classification using PyTorch and Lightning

Project Description:
A PyTorch-based project for classifying images of various bird species using transfer learning and pretrained models. The project leverages PyTorch Lightning for efficient training and testing, with a custom dataset loader for bird images stored in Google Drive.

Dataset:
Images of 9 bird species, including duck, eagle, flamingo, hawk, owl, peacock, penguin, and more.
Stored in separate subfolders (e.g., duck/, eagle/).
Dataset format: .png
Total images: 1729
Features:
Data preprocessing: resizing, cropping, and normalization.
Pretrained models from torchvision.models for transfer learning.
Modular training using PyTorch Lightning.
